After watching a couple of tutorials about bubble.io and playing around with it for a bit, I do have some thoughts regarding our application of it for this course. I personally think this will be a great tool for us because of its very user-friendly interface and easy-to-understand tutorials. However, some downsides include the fact that in order to get the full experience purchasing is likely required. As with any kind of new software, there are some things that I would also need to get used to as well. Such as the workflow of the program and how to work with it to get what I want. 

When making a mobile app, we must consider a lot of things both in and outside the app. In the app, we have to consider how we would want our interface to flow and where things will be. What colors and layout will we choose? How do we make using it accessible? How would we organize the app functions? Then outside the app, we have to consider who we are making it for, how to best market to our target demographic, and how we could present ourselves in the best way possible. 
Of course, using bubble.io has its limits. As mentioned earlier, if we want the full experience we’re gonna have to pay with actual money. Next, there might be only so much we can do with bubble.io that we will have to get creative when it comes to implementing things or have to leave it on the cutting room floor. If we do get creative, we would have to make sure our methods don’t bug out on us, cause problems using the app, and be nothing but spaghetti code. 

Overall, I’m excited to see where things are with the development of the app, and how we will use bubble.io in the future. There will be challenges and setbacks that we will definitely face, but I have faith we can work through them.
